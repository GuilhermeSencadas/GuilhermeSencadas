# Welcome :wave:

My name is Guilherme Sencadas.

I'm a Junior Engineer who wants to communicate and learn with other people.

I'm lookinng to work at either front-end or back-end development. Although not very experienced in front-end, I believe with some guidance I can complete the desired tasks.

I've experienced AGILE through SCRUM and I'm hoping to develop my knowledge on Software Architecture and Programminng principles.

# Hobbies

* **Cycling** :bike: - Love to go for a ride once in a while to feel refreshed. It feels incredible after a long week of work to get on a bike and ride near the beach.
  
* **Gaming** :video_game: - What I love about gaming is the endless possibilities that it has. You can experience new worlds, meet new people and know new and original stories.

* **Music** :musical_keyboard: - Although I'm a beginner, I love to play piano, guitar, etc. in my free times. It calms me down at stressful times and allows me to create new things every time.

* **Sleep** :sleeping: : I value sleep! I believe sleep is truly essential for my life and health. It changes my mood and energy throughout the day.
